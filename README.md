#Statuser
Statuser tracks user status in Firefox. You can get it here:
https://chutten.github.io/statuser/dist/

The current version is 0.0.5

* If the user is considered active, it will take the shape of a red square.
* If the user is considered inactive, it will take the shape of a blue circle.
* If there is a toplevel navigation load happening, it will spin.
* If there has been a Gecko-main event delay > 126ms, the badge counter will increment and change colour.

If you click the button, the counter will reset.
